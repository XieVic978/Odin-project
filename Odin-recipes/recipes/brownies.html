    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These brownies will melt in your mouth after the first bite. Is also a christmas favorite/delicacy. This recipe will definitely save your life.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
      <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
      <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>*If you'd like to reduce the sugar, I've had success with 1 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.</p>
    <p>**I like to use olive oil because it's what I keep on hand and I enjoy the pairing of olive oil with chocolate. Keep in mind that you will taste it here. For a more neutral flavor, use canola oil.</p>
    <p>***When these brownies come out of the oven, they'll be super gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool completely, about 2 hours, before you slice into them to give them a chance to set up. They'll continue to firm up the longer they're out of the oven. If you still prefer a firmer brownie, store them in the fridge.</p>
